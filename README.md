# System Architecture

The application follows a **client–server architecture**.

**Frontend (React)**
Handles user interface and user interactions.

**Backend (Flask API)**

**Database (SQLite)**
Stores user accounts and expense records.

Workflow:

User → React Frontend → Flask API → SQLite Database → Response → UI Update
